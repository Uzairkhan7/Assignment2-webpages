        <p style="text-align: left">The Way Dogs and Cats Exercise Is Quite Different
            If you're looking for a workout buddy,<br> a cat may not be your best choice. While cats are known to be agile and will occasionally <br> spend time playing games with you, they aren't known to be athletic, per se. Dogs,<br>  on the other hand, are usually great exercise pals. Many breeds enjoy running and hiking, <br> and will happily trek along on any trip. <br>
            Just because cats aren't into exercise, doesn't mean they aren't nimble. Cats have lean muscles <br> and will pounce or leap when stalking prey, even if that prey happens to be a fun feather toy <br> you're swaying back and forth on the carpet.
                Playtime with dogs and cats is also very different.<br> While many dogs enjoy a game of fetch, cats will often watch you toss a ball, and then walk away,<br> unwilling to join in on your game. For a cat, fun playtime may consist of pouncing on your feet <br> when you're lying under the covers and sleeping. Cats are nocturnal animals, says the Animal <br> Humane Society, and enjoy playing at night, when your dog is most likely snoring gently. <br>
                Pack Mentality Differs for the Two Species
                Dogs are pack members, and throughout history, <br> have worked in groups. Because of this, they see their pet parent as the pack leader, looking <br> for direction and following it closely. Dogs tend to work together to get things done, so your <br> dog will involve himself in your routines as a way to connect with you. </p>
